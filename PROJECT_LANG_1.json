{"About:"}
{"I decided to make JSON5 the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-JSON5) as JSON5 is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the JSON5 programming language. It only makes sense to JSON5 the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."}
